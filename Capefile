# Capefile is the setup file for Caperoma management system.
# More info about Caperoma can be found here: http://caperoma.io

# Use YAML to set required properties.

# --- GITHUB PROPERTIES:
#
# github_repo: <a git path to your github repo>
#
# Set a git repo, into which all the pull requests will be sent.
# You need to have a right to make pull requests into this repo.
#
# Example:
# github_repo: owner/repository
#
# Uncomment this and change to your repo:
github_repo: zoopyserg/testproject

# --- JIRA PROPERTIES:
# jira_url: <a full URL for your Jira server>
# If jira_url is not set, Jira will not be used with your project.
#
# Example:
# jira_url: https://example.atlassian.net/
#
# Uncomment this and change to your Jira url if you use Jira:
jira_url: https://zoopyserg.atlassian.net/

# Then run "caperoma sync" to fetch your Jira projects.
# Then run "caperoma projects" to see the list of fetched projects.

# jira_project_id: <the ID of this project in your Jira system>
#
# If you don't know its Jira ID, run 'caperoma sync' and then 'caperoma projects'.
# 'caperoma projects' will have something like this:
# Your awesome project (Jira project ID: 12345)
# So your jira_project_id in this case will be 12345.
#
# If jira_project_id is not set, Jira will not be used with your project.
#
# Example:
# jira_project_id: 12345
# 
# Uncomment this and change to your Jira Project ID if you use Jira:
# jira_project_id: 12345
jira_project_id: 10000

# jira_issue_ids: the issue ids of different types of issues in your Jira system.
# Put appropriate IDs here.
# If unsure, run "caperoma get_issue_ids" (doesn't work for now).
# Keep in mind, that these IDs may be different if you switch to a different Jira server.
#
# Example (uncomment if you use Jira)
# jira_issue_type_ids:
#   feature: 10101
#   bug: 10103
#   chore: 10100
#   fix: 10101
#   meeting: 10100
jira_issue_type_ids:
  feature: 10101
  bug: 10103
  chore: 10100
  fix: 10101
  meeting: 10100

# jira_transition_ids: Transition ids for Jira ()
# To get them, run "caperoma get_transition_ids" (doesn't work for now).
# Can also be taken here: <URL>
#
# Example (uncomment if you use Jira):
jira_transition_ids:
  todo: 11
  in_progress: 21
  done: 31

# --- PIVOTAL TRACKER PROPERTIES:
# Pivotal Tracker Project ID:
pivotal_tracker_project_id: 2361193

# Once you run a command like "caperoma feature", you start working on a feature locally.
# Caperoma will use the ID of the Pivotal task that you provide with a flag --pivotal_issue_id.
# However if you DON'T provide this flag (hense, your local "feature" has no pivotal ID assigned to it), pivotal has no idea that you started working on it.
# Thus, these options allow you to CREATE a feature/bug/chore in Pivotal (if you didn't use --pivotal_issue_id flag to provide PT task, Caperoma will create a new task inside your project use its id)
# OMFG how hard it is to explain. The point is that if you provide --pivotal_issue_id - caperoma will use that issue_id. But if you don't provide --pivotal_issue_id flag, with these options you can choose if you want Caperoma to CREATE that issue inside of your pivotal project, or NOT CREATE (by setting true/false on each of them).
create_features_in_pivotal: false
create_bugs_in_pivotal: true
create_chores_in_pivotal: true
create_fixes_in_pivotal_as_chores: false
create_meetings_in_pivotal_as_chores: false
